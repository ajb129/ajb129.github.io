<h1>About English Puzzle Graphs</h1>
<h3>Alastair Butler<br>Hirosaki University</h3>

<br><h2><a name="sec1">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims</h2>

<p align="justify">You can study English while having fun with English puzzle graphs. You will learn about word interactions while solving puzzles. The puzzles will help you understand how word connections can guide the building of sentences. Goals for working through the puzzles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>to get a feeling for how words interact with each other (word dependencies)</li>
<li>to learn about the components that go into building up connected sentences; this includes complex sentences, which are sentences with multiple clauses, and when sentences occur one after another</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A puzzle takes the form of a graph of words with labelled arrows that connect the graph nodes. The labelled arrows are clues for building sentence components. The puzzle task is to turn each graph of words with its clues into a &lsquo;solution&rsquo; that is a sentence fragment, a single sentence (that is possibly complex) or multiple sentences (each of which can be complex). You can check your success by seeing if your solution matches the suggested answer.</p>

<br><h2><a name="sec2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to read a puzzle graph</h2>

<p align="justify">In a puzzle graph, word content for a puzzle solution occurs outside of square brackets (&lsquo;<tt>[</tt>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<tt>]</tt>&rsquo;).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content inside square brackets tells us about word function, which is what words <i>do</i> in their sentences. These are clues that inform where words should go in puzzle solutions.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Square bracket content should not be included in a puzzle solution. In contrast, all word content should be included. You never have to modify the forms of words, so a word should occur in a puzzle solution as you find it in the graph.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words and&sol;or square bracket content can be the label content for a graph node. They can also provide the label content for a directed arrow that connects graph nodes. An arrow connects one node (the <b>governor node</b>) to another node (the <b>dependent node</b>). It is typical for the label content of an arrow to be square bracket content (what the dependent is <i>doing</i> for the governor).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the words needed for a puzzle solution are found in the graph, but sometimes you will need to add additional &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; words. Some of the invisible words will turn out to be words that are involved with referencing what is talked about. These words can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>bound pronouns</b> (e.g., <i>he</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>themselves</i>) which are used to reference already established graph nodes introduced because of earlier words</li>
<li><b>definites together with following nouns</b> (e.g., <i>the garden</i>, <i>the tool-shed</i>) when used to reference already familiar graph nodes introduced because of earlier words</li>
<li><b>proper nouns</b> (e.g., <i>Peter</i>, <i>Mr.&nbsp;McGregor</i>) when used to reference already familiar graph nodes introduced because of earlier instances of the same proper noun</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Note that pronouns that cannot be associated with something else from the discourse context (called unbound pronouns) do have graph presence. Similarly, definites (e.g., <i>the</i>, <i>these</i>, <i>this</i>) that cannot be associated with something else from the discourse context have a graph presence as graph node content together with any following noun content.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other invisible words are words that have a formal role marking grammatical structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>relative pronouns</b>, e.g., <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, used at the start of a relative clause (<i>Mr.&nbsp;McGregor came up with a sieve, <u>which</u> he intended to pop upon the top of Peter</i>)</li>
<li>the <b>complementizer</b> <i>that</i> used at the start of an embedded clause (<i>Mr.&nbsp;McGregor was sure <u>that</u> Peter was somewhere</i>, <i>I am sorry to say <u>that</u> Peter was not very well</i>)</li>
<li>the <b>infinitive marker</b> <i>to</i> used at the start of a <i>to</i>-infinitive clause (<i>a beautiful thing <u>to</u> hide in</i>, <i>Peter sat down <u>to</u> rest</i>)</li>
<li>the <b>connective particle</b> <i>for</i> placed before the grammatical subject of a <i>to</i>-infinitive clause (<i>Mr.&nbsp;McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes <u>for</u> a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds</i>, <i>no room <u>for</u> a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath</i>)</li>
<li>the <b>existential marker</b> <i>there</i> used to signal a <i>there</i> construction (<i><u>there</u> were four Rabbits</i>)</li>
<li><b>dummy</b> <i>it</i>, e.g., in extraposition constructions (<i>Peter thought <u>it</u> best to go away</i>), cleft constructions (<i><u>It</u> was the second jacket that Peter had lost</i>) and weather reports (<i><u>it</u> is raining</i>)</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible for a node to have as its content the underscore character (&lsquo;_&rsquo;) and nothing else. This indicates an absence from a puzzle solution that we are nevertheless able to associate to a meaning, as will be illustrated with the discussion of ellipsis in section <a href="#sec3.2">3.2</a> below.</p>

<br><h2><a name="sec3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tips for reaching puzzle solutions</h2>

<p align="justify">This section offers tips for reaching puzzle solutions. This starts with a simple puzzle. Then we gradually pick up skills to tackle more complex puzzles.</p>

<h3><a name="sec3.1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple puzzle</h3>

<p align="justify">To form a puzzle solution, start by looking into a puzzle graph for an arrow that includes <tt>[arg0]</tt> in its label. The governor node for such an arrow will be the main verb content for a clause, possibly with other supporting words, while the dependent node will be the <b>logical subject</b> for the clause, which is the &lsquo;do-er&rsquo; or &lsquo;be-er&rsquo; or &lsquo;have-er&rsquo; of the clause.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a>. This gives the puzzle graph for a single clause. By finding the arrow labelled <tt>[arg0]</tt>, we identify <tt>were</tt> as the main verb. We also identify <tt>four_Rabbits</tt> as the &lsquo;be-er&rsquo; (logical subject).</p>

<center>
<img src="clausetherewerepic.png">
<br>
<br>
<a name="figure1"><b>Figure 1</b>: Puzzle graph for a single clause</a>
</center>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the main verb of a clause is a form of the verb <small style="font-size: 75%">BE</small> (like <i>were</i>) and there is no predicative connection (<tt>[prd]</tt>, as in Figure <a href="#figure2">2</a> below), then a typical clause will have existential marker <i>there</i> as its initial word followed by a <small style="font-size: 75%">BE</small> verb followed by an <tt>[arg0]</tt> dependent. With this knowledge, we can construct (<a href="#ex1">1</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex1">1</a>)</dt><dd>
there were four Rabbits
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">Note that (<a href="#ex1">1</a>) includes <i>there</i> as the first word, and yet this word is not part of Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a>. This is an example of an &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; word. As noted in section <a href="#sec2">2</a> above, the puzzle solution might need to include words that are not found in the puzzle graph.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With (<a href="#ex1">1</a>), we already have a full sentence of English! However, (<a href="#ex1">1</a>) is not a complete puzzle solution for Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a>, since there are words that have yet to be used. One of these words comes at the end of an arrow that has <tt>four_Rabbits</tt> as its governor node. This word acts as an attributive modifier (<tt>[attrib]</tt>) to tell us about the size of the four rabbits (<tt>little</tt>). In English, numeral <tt>four</tt> should occur before an attributive adjective modifier to give (<a href="#ex2">2</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex2">2</a>)</dt><dd>
there were four little Rabbits
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a> also has an arrow labelled <tt>[nim]</tt> (unselected adverbial function) that has the main verb as its governor node and that points to the complex adverb <tt>Once_upon_a_time</tt>. Connecting these words gives the final puzzle solution for Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a> of (<a href="#ex3">3</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex3">3</a>)</dt><dd>
Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another example, consider Figure <a href="#figure2">2</a>, which also has content for a single clause sentence.</p>

<center>
<img src="clausenameswerepic.png">
<br>
<br>
<a name="figure2"><b>Figure 2</b>: Puzzle graph for another single clause</a>
</center>

<p align="justify">Searching for an <tt>[arg0]</tt> labelled arrow, we find <i>were</i> once again as the main verb of the clause. The &lsquo;be-er&rsquo; (logical subject) of the clause is <tt>names</tt>, which itself has an arrow labelled <tt>[gen]</tt> (genitive), which takes us to the genitive pronoun <tt>their</tt>. There is also an arrow labelled <tt>[prd]</tt> (predicative), which provides name content with dependent <tt>and</tt>, which in turn has four dependent conjuncts. Each conjunct is linked with a <tt>[conjN]</tt> labelled arrow, where <tt>N</tt> is a conjunct's place in an ordering of all the conjuncts. Turning all this into an English sentence gives (<a href="#ex4">4</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex4">4</a>)</dt><dd>
their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter
</dd></dl>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now consider Figure <a href="#figure3">3</a>.</p>

<center>
<img src="twoconjoinedclausespic.png">
<br>
<br>
<a name="figure3"><b>Figure 3</b>: Puzzle graph combining Figures <a href="#figure1">1</a> and <a href="#figure2">2</a></a>
</center>

<p align="justify">This third puzzle graph brings together content from the two previous puzzle graphs with connections of material at two different graph nodes. First, there is connection from the very top node of the graph with the word <tt>and</tt>. Nodes corresponding to the main verb nodes of the two earlier graphs form the dependent nodes of arrows labelled <tt>[conjN]</tt>, much as we saw with the connections that led to <i>Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, <b><i>and</i></b> Peter</i>. We can therefore expect to reach a puzzle solution that is essentially the content of (<a href="#ex3">3</a>) connected by <i>and</i> to the content of (<a href="#ex4">4</a>).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one further point of connection that we also need to make sense of: The arrow labelled <tt>[gen]</tt> of Figure <a href="#figure3">3</a> does not have a node with content <i>their</i> as its dependent like in Figure <a href="#figure2">2</a>, but rather takes as its dependent <tt>four_Rabbits</tt>, which corresponds to the <tt>four_Rabbits</tt> of Figure <a href="#figure1">1</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can interpret the <tt>[gen]</tt> labelled arrow as having an &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; instance of <i>their</i> as its dependent. This absence of <i>their</i> from the puzzle graph occurs because presence of <i>their</i> in the solution sentence is instead captured in the graph as a direct arrow connection (referential link) to the already graph present <tt>four_Rabbits</tt>. We are therefore justified to take &lsquo;(<a href="#ex3">3</a>) <i>and</i> (<a href="#ex4">4</a>)&rsquo; &mdash; namely (<a href="#ex5">5</a>) &mdash; to be the overall puzzle solution for the graph of Figure <a href="#figure3">3</a>.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex5">5</a>)</dt><dd>
Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.

<h3><a name="sec3.2">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example with ellipsis</h3>

<p align="justify">Figure <a href="#figure4">4</a> has a similar structure to Figure <a href="#figure3">3</a>, in the sense that there are two verbs connected by <tt>[conj1]</tt> and <tt>[conj2]</tt> labelled arrows from <tt>and</tt> occurring topmost in the graph. However, while the verb of the first conjunct is overtly realised with <tt>lost</tt>, the content for the verb of the second conjunct is shown as node labelled &lsquo;<tt>_</tt>&rsquo; to indicate an absence (a lost <i>lost</i>!) from the puzzle solution.</p>

<a name="figure4"><b>Figure 4</b>: Puzzle graph with ellipsis</a>

<p align="justify">Following all the links of Figure <a href="#figure4">4</a>, we can arrive at puzzle solution (<a href="#ex6">6</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex6">6</a>)</dt><dd>

<h3><a name="sec3.3">3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complex puzzle</h3>

<p align="justify">This section demonstrates how to approach a complex puzzle. We will break this into stages, first building content for simpler graphs, which then combine to give larger graphs, and so ultimately lead to the final graph for reaching the overall puzzle solution.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start, consider figure 5.</p>

<center>
<img src="handsandkneespic.png">
<br>
<br>
<a name="figure5"><b>Figure 5</b>: Puzzle graph for a single clause</a>
</center>

<p align="justify">By finding <tt>[arg0]</tt>, we can identify <tt>was_on</tt> as a predicate with <tt>Mr._McGregor</tt> as the &lsquo;be-er&rsquo; (logical subject). One other arrow extends from <tt>was_on</tt>. This is labelled <tt>[arg1]</tt> and connects to <tt>and</tt>, which takes us to two conjuncts via the labelled connections <tt>[conj1]</tt> leading to <tt>hands</tt> and <tt>[conj2]</tt> leading to <tt>knees</tt>. One more connection, labelled <tt>[gen]</tt> (genitive/possessive), originates from <tt>and</tt> and leads to <tt>Mr._McGregor</tt> to capture the information that the <tt>hands</tt> and <tt>knees</tt> are those of <i>Mr.&nbsp;McGregor</i>. By following these connections and including <i>his</i> to capture the genitive/possessive connection, we can reach (<a href="#ex7">7</a>) as the puzzle solution.</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex7">7</a>)</dt><dd>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now consider Figure <a href="#figure6">6</a>.</p>

<center>
<img src="plantingpic.png">
<br>
<br>
<a name="figure6"><b>Figure 6</b>: Puzzle content for a participle clause</a>
</center>

<p align="justify">An arrow labelled <tt>[arg1]</tt> (logical object) extends to <tt>cabbages</tt> having started from <tt>planting_out</tt>. In turn, <tt>cabbages</tt> leads via an <tt>[attrib]</tt> (attribute) labelled arrow to <tt>young</tt>. By following these connections of the graph, we reach the sentence fragment (<a href="#ex8">8</a>).</p>

<dl><dt>(<a name="ex8">8</a>)</dt><dd>

<p align="justify">Figure <a href="#figure7">7</a> has connections to bring together node content from Figures <a href="#figure5">5</a> and <a href="#figure6">6</a>. There is a <tt>[cnt]</tt> node (continuative subordinate conjunction) to state that <tt>planting_out</tt> acts as a restriction on the content from <tt>was_on</tt>. There is also an <tt>[arg0]</tt> connection from <tt>planting_out</tt> to <tt>Mr._McGregor</tt>, the &lsquo;be-er&rsquo; (logical subject) of the main clause. A puzzle solution that meets these new criteria of Figure <a href="#figure7">7</a> is (<a href="#ex9">9</a>).</p>

<p align="justify">Looking at <tt>jumped_up</tt>, this is linked to <tt>he</tt> with an <tt>[arg0]</tt> labelled arrow. Therefore, we can identify <i>jumped_up</i> as a predicate with <i>he</i> as its &lsquo;do-er&rsquo; (logical subject), to derive the simple sentence of (<a href="#ex10">10</a>).</p>
